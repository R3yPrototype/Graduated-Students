This app is made for school as a semestrial project. Is about introducing details of students like name, age and credits (between 1 and 60). The students details can be seen in a 
textbox after send, so we can introduce as many students as we want. We can save in a txt file the graduated students (who has a minimal of 30 credits). The txt file is located in 
the bin folder of the project.
